    "# Time Series Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows using [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) and Dask for scalable time series forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the [*Forecasting at scale*](https://peerj.com/preprints/3190/), large datasets aren't the only type of scaling challenge teams run into. In this example we'll focus on the third type of scaling challenege indentified in that paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [I]n most realistic settings, a large number of forecasts will be created, necessitating efficient, automated means of evaluating and comparing them, as well as detecting when they are likely to be performing poorly. When hundreds or even thousands of forecasts are made, it becomes important to let machines do the hard work of model evaluation and comparison while efficiently using human feedback to fix performance problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "That sounds like a perfect opportunity for Dask. We'll use Prophet and Dask together to parallize the *diagnostics* stage of research. It does not attempt to parallize the training of the model itself."

By default each model is fit sequentially, but the models can be trained in parallel using the `parallel=` keyword. On a single machine `parallel=\"processes\"` is a good choice. For large problems where you'd like to distribute the work on a cluster, use `parallel=\"dask\"` after you've connected to the cluster by creating a `Client`."
