Welcome To Dask Examples
========================

This is a live session from which you can run example notebooks showing how to use Dask.

A file browser listing example notebooks is available to the left.  There are overview notebooks about topics like arrays, dataframes, and machine learning at the top-level, as well as more focused notebooks within sub-directories.

Dask dashboard plots are available to the right.  These will activate when you
run the cells in your Jupyter notebooks that create a Dask `Client` (these are already written for you).

To get started, double click on a notebook on the left, like `dataframe.ipynb`, and start running through the Jupyter notebook cells.

Links are available within each notebook for additional documentation on that topic.
