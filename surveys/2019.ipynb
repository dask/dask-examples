    "which ran earlier this summer. Thanks to everyone who took the time to fill out the survey!\n",

    "We had 259 responses to the survey. Overall, we found that the survey respondents really care about improved documentation, and ease of use (including ease of deployment), and scaling. While Dask brings together many different communities (big arrays versus big dataframes, traditional HPC users versus cloud-native resource managers), there was general agreement in what is most important for Dask.\n",
