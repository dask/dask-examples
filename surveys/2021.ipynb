    "- Works with gigabyte sized datasets\n",
    "- Stored on a local filesystem\n",
    "- Has been using Dask between 1 and 3 years\n",
    "- Uses Dask occasionally, not every day\n",
    "- Uses Dask interactively at least part of the time\n",
    "- Uses a compute cluster (probably)\n",
    "- Likes to view the Dask dashboard with a web browser\n",
    "- For the most part, Dask is stable enough for their needs, but improving the Dask's resiliancy would be helpful\n",
    "- Uses the Dask dataframe, delayed, and maybe the Dask Array API, alongside numpy/pandas and other python libraries\n",
    "- The most useful thing that would help this person is more documentation, and more examples using Dask in their field.\n",

    "He found these recurring themes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intermediate Documentation\n",
    "- Documentation Organization\n",
    "- Functionality\n",
    "- High Level Optimization\n",
    "- Runtime Stability and Advanced Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "Since more documentation and examples were the two most requested improvements, I'll summarize some of the steps forward in that area here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regarding more intermediate documentation, Matt says:\n",
    "    >  There is a lot of good potential material that advanced users have around performance and debugging that could be fun to publish.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matt points out that Dask has excellent *reference documentation*, but lacks a lot of good *narrative documentation*. To address this, Julia Signell is currently investigating how we could improve the organization of Dask's documentation (you can subscribe to [this issue thread](https://github.com/dask/community/issues/170) if you want to follow that discussion)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matt comments that it's hard to have good *narrative documentation* when there are so many different *user narratives* (i.e. Dask is used by people from many different industries). This year, we added a new question to the survey asking for the industry people work in. We added this because *\"More examples in my field\"* has been one of the top two requests for the last three years. Now we can use that information to better target narrative documentation to the areas that need it most (geoscience, life science, and finance)."
